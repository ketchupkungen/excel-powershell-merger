# Excel-PowerShell-Merger

### Description
This is a fairly simple PowerShell file that on activation, prompts the user if he/she wants to create a Excel-file that on creation copies specified content from two other specified Excel-files on the computer and pastes in the new file, the new file is in turn named after the current date. On completion the file also prompts the user that it is done.

I included a cmd-file for ease to use the PowerShell file.



### How to use
Simply change the paths in the ps1 file and in the cmd file to fit your computer, and also check the name of the Excel files you want to copy from.

When that is done, all you have to do is run the cmd file and the merging will begin!
